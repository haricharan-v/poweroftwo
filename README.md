## Introduction

The `isPowerOfTwo` script is designed to determine whether a given number is a power of two or not. The script utilizes a straightforward algorithm to check if the provided number is divisible by two until it reaches the value of 1. If the number is a power of two, the script returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

## Prerequisites

Before using the script, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.x recommended)

## Usage

### stdin

The script accepts user input through the standard input (stdin). When you run the script, it prompts you to enter a number. You can input both numeric and string representations of numbers.

### stdout

The script outputs the result to the standard output (stdout). It prints a message indicating whether the entered number is a power of two or not.

## Example

```bash
python isPowerOfTwo.py
```

```python
Enter a number, and we'll check if the number is a power of two: 16
True. The number '16.0' is a power of two!
```

```python
Enter a number, and we'll check if the number is a power of two: 7
False. The number '7.0' is not a power of two!
```
